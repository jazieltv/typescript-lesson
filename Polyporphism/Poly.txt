Polymorphism provides the ability for us to design for dynamic runtime behavior, 
easy extensibility, and substitutability.

Polymorphism is very important in a statically typed language. 
It lets you substitute values basic on this polymorphic principle.

Polymorphism is the abstract concept of dealing with multiple types in a 
uniform manner, and interfaces are a way to implement that concept. Code 
that interacts with an interface can interact with any type that provides that interface.

In a nutshell, it means one object having many forms.
