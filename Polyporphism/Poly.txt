Polymorphism provides the ability for us to design for dynamic runtime behavior, 
easy extensibility, and substitutability.

Polymorphism is very important in a statically typed language. 
It lets you substitute values basic on this polymorphic principle.

In a nutshell, it means one object having many forms.
