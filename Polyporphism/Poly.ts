      TypeScript FOR THE WINNN !!*/

// The program compiles and runs just fine.
// This is due to the fact that TypeScriptâ€™s type system is based on the shape of the values
// and not on what concrete type values have.

//many=forms
//tehcnnique that that allows to replace conditionals
//allows you to create a class that has more thsn one form
