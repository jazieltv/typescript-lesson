Abstraction is the process of exposing only the essential features of an object 
and hiding the implementation details.

Abstraction is a key principle of design. 
Since object-oriented programs can get quite large, 
it's just not humanly possible to expect others to be aware of the inner-workings of each and every class,
or component within them. 
Therefore, we strive to abstract objects in a way that makes them intention-revealing, 
simple to use, and simple to understand.
