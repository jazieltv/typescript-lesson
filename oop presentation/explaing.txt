Going to be discussing the four terms:
    Encapsulation
    Abstraction
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism

While presenting the four terms will be creating classes that have a constructor method and 2 methods

Class is a blueprint for creating objects:
        class restaurantWorkers {
                name: string;
                salary: number;


A contructor Method is a special function of the class that is responsible for 
intializing the variables of the class
        class restaurantWorkers {
            name: string;
            salary: number;

        constructor(name: string, salary: number) {
            this.name = name;
            this.salary = salary;
            }

a method is a block of code, defined inside a class and only executed when being called. 
Methods divide a large task into small parts and perform the specific operation of that program

        class restaurantWorkers {
            name: string;
            salary: number;

        constructor(name: string, salary: number) {
            this.name = name;
            this.salary = salary;
            }

        giveInfo() {
            return `${this.name} + " is making " + ${this.salary}';
            }
        }
